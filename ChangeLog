	* lib/bio/shell/setup.rb, core.rb

	  Changed not to use Dir.chdir by caching full path of the save
	  directory at a start up time, so that user can freely change
	  the work directory without affecting object/history saving
	  functionality.

	  Bio::Shell.cache[:savedir] stores the session saving directory
	  (session means shell/session/{config,history,object} files),
	  Bio::Shell.cache[:workdir] stores the working directory at a start
	  up time (can be same directory with the :savedir) and both are
	  converted and stored as full path allowing user to use Dir.chdir
	  in the shell session).

	  If --rails (-r) option is applied, 'bioruby' command will run in
	  the Rails server mode, and the server will start in the :savedir.

	  (A) IRB mode

	  1. run in the current directory and the session will be saved
	     in the ~/.bioruby directory

	       % bioruby

	  2. run in the current directory and the session will be saved
	     in the foo/bar directory

	       % bioruby foo/bar

	  3. run in the current directory and the session will be saved
	     in the /tmp/foo/bar directory

	       % bioruby /tmp/foo/bar

	  (B) Rails mode

	  4. run in the ~/.bioruby directory and the session will also be saved
	     in the ~/.bioruby directory

	       % bioruby -r

	  5. run in the foo/bar directory and the session will also be saved
	     in the foo/bar directory

	       % bioruby -r foo/bar

	  6. run in the /tmp/foo/bar directory and the session will also be
	     saved in the /tmp/foo/bar directory

	       % bioruby -r /tmp/foo/bar

	  (C) Script mode

	  7. run in the current directory using the session saved
	     in the ~/.bioruby directory

	       % bioruby ~/.bioruby/shell/script.rb

	  8. run in the current directory using the session saved
	     in the foo/bar directory

	       % bioruby foo/bar/shell/script.rb

	  9. run in the current directory using the session saved
	     in the /tmp/foo/bar directory

	       % bioruby /tmp/foo/bar/shell/script.rb

2007-06-21  Toshiaki Katayama <k@bioruby.org>

	* lib/bio/shell/setup.rb

	  If no directory is specified to the bioruby command,
	  use ~/.bioruby directory as the default save directory
	  instead of the current directory, as suggested by Jun Sese.

	  User can use 'bioruby' command without botherd by directories
	  and files previously created by the 'bioruby' command
	  in the current directory even when not needed.

2007-05-19  Toshiaki Katayama <k@bioruby.org>

	* lib/bio/appl/fasta.rb

	* lib/bio/db/gff.rb

	  parser_attributes method in GFF3 class is modified to use
	  '=' char as a separator instead of ' ' (which is used in
	  GFF2 spec).

2007-04-06  Toshiaki Katayama <k@bioruby.org>

	* COPYING, COPYING.LIB are removed

	  BioRuby is now distributed under the same terms as Ruby.

	  On behalf of the BioRuby developer, I have asked all authors of
	  the BioRuby code to change BioRuby's license from LGPL to Ruby's.
	  And we have finished to change license of all modules in the BioRuby
	  library. This means that Ruby user can freely use BioRuby library
	  without being annoyed by licensing issues.

	* lib/bio/db/kegg/ko.rb is renamed to lib/bio/db/kegg/ortholog.rb

	  KEGG KO database is renamed to KEGG ORTHOLOG database, thus we
